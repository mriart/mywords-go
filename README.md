# mywords-go
This is a flash card solution for learning the English words I found I don't know. 

It is the second edition. The first was project mywords-js. This is based on Go, quicker and more efficient (and eager to learn). It is also based on Cloudant from my IBM Cloud account.


It is for personal use, but you can visit this "basic" code for whatever reason.
